        <h3>Key requirements for the ranking process:</h3>
        <p class="bodyText">
            The final rankings were determined by a weighted combination of three components: Classification score: 
            40% weight, Segmentation score: 40% weight, and Processing Time score: 20% weight. Considering that the 
            objective of this task is to comprehensively evaluate the risk of carotid plaques through both classification 
            and segmentation, we deemed classification and segmentation to be more critical than processing time, 
            higher weights are assigned to these two aspects compared to processing time. This comprehensive evaluation 
            aligns with the challenge’s objective to assess both segmentation, classification, and computational 
            performance, ensuring a multi-dimensional assessment of participants’ solutions. The overall score is calculated as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          $$ S_{\text{total}} = 0.4\,S_{\text{cls}} + 0.4\,S_{\text{seg}} + 0.2\,S_{\text{time}} $$
        </p>

        <p class="bodyText">
            Where $ S_{\text{cls}} $ represents classification score, $ S_{\text{seg}} $ represents segmentation score, and $ S_{\text{time}} $ represents 
            processing time score. Figure 1 illustrates the overall score framework of our challenge.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="bodyText">
            <b>1. Classification Score: </b>Class imbalance is an inherent issue in this task. To comprehensively evaluate 
            classification performance, we adopt the mean F1-score across all classes as the final classification score. 
            The calculation formula is as follows:
        </p>
        $$
        S_{Cls} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} F_{1_i}
        $$
        <p class="bodyText">
            Where $ N $ denotes the total number of classes.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="bodyText">
            <b>2. Segmentation Score: </b>As shown in Figure 1, in the semi-supervised segmentation task, segmentation 
            score is calculated by both the vessel and plaque of the longitudinal and transverse views, each contributing 
            50% to the overall segmentation score. 
        </p>
        <p class="bodyText">
            For each view, the score is calculated based on two evaluation metrics — Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) 
            and Normalized Surface Dice (NSD) — which are equally weighted (50%). Considering that accurate plaque segmentation 
            is more clinically important than vessel segmentation, we assign a weight of 40% to the vessel and 60% to the plaque. 
            The segmentation score is calculated as follows:
        </p>
          $$
          S_{\text{seg}}
          = \frac{1}{2}
          \sum_{v \in \{\text{long},\,\text{trans}\}}
          \Big( 0.4\, S_{v,\text{vessel}} + 0.6\, S_{v,\text{plaque}} \Big)
          $$
        <p class="bodyText">
            Where
            $$
              S_{v,\text{vessel}} =
              \frac{DSC_{v,\text{vessel}} + NSD_{v,\text{vessel}}}{2},
              \quad
              S_{v,\text{plaque}} =
              \frac{DSC_{v,\text{plaque}} + NSD_{v,\text{plaque}}}{2}
              $$

        <p class="bodyText">
            Here, $ v $ denotes the view type (longitudinal and transverse).

        <br>
        <p class="bodyText">
            <b>3. Processing Time Score: </b>The processing time score is calculated based on the participant's 
            inference time relative to a baseline time. The scoring rules are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 80px;">
            <li class="bodyText" style="list-style-type: disc;">If a participant's time was \( \leq 2/3 \) of the baseline time, their time usage was set to

            <li class="bodyText" style="list-style-type: disc;">If a participant's time was \( \geq 2 \) of the baseline time, their time usage was set to 
                <strong>\( -(2 \times \text{baseline time}) \)</strong>.</li>
            <li class="bodyText" style="list-style-type: disc;">Otherwise, it was set to <strong>\( -(\text{total time})\)</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="bodyText">
            After min-max normalization and score transformation was applied to yield a [0, 100] score. 
        </p>    
        <p class="bodyText">
            The processing time score is calculated as follows:

          Each case includes B-mode carotid ultrasound images from two views: the longitudinal and transverse. For each 
          case, segmentation results should be provided separately for both views, while a single classification result 
          should be generated based on the combined information from both views.
